# relative-photometry
A collection of python 3 code meant to be used for Relative Photometry of astronomical objects, specifically Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).

Going to slowly add all of the python files I have created throughout my graduate career to help others do this type of work. Most of these initial uploads will certainly be messy but hopefully will be legible enough to the average user.
